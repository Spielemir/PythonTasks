when you have made all your changes
1. write in terminal `black .`

### git add
`git add file_name` - add file to stage(index)

`git add .` - add all changes or new files to stage(index)
### git commit
`git commit -m 'your commit message'` - create commit (create point in history project)

where -m says that you want to leave a message to commit

`git commit -am 'your commit message'` - create commit (create point in history project)

where -am means you want to add all changed files to the commit, use this instead of git add if you have no new files, only changed
### git push
`git push` - pushing your commit in your fork repository

all command in one line ->

`git add . && git commit -m "your text" && git push`

## Making a pull request

To do so, head on over to the repository on GitHub where your project lives. 

You'll see a banner indicating that your branch is one commit ahead of main.

Click Contribute and then Open a pull request.

GitHub will bring you to a page that shows the differences between your fork and the PythonTasks repository. 

### Click Create pull request.
